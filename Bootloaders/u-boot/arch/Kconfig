config SYS_ARCH
	string
	help
	  This option should contain the architecture name to build the
	  appropriate arch/<CONFIG_SYS_ARCH> directory.
	  All the architectures should specify this option correctly.

config SYS_CPU
	string
	help
	  This option should contain the CPU name to build the correct
	  arch/<CONFIG_SYS_ARCH>/cpu/<CONFIG_SYS_CPU> directory.

	  This is optional.  For those targets without the CPU directory,
	  leave this option empty.

config SYS_SOC
	string
	help
	  This option should contain the SoC name to build the directory
	  arch/<CONFIG_SYS_ARCH>/cpu/<CONFIG_SYS_CPU>/<CONFIG_SYS_SOC>.

config SYS_VENDOR
	string
	help
	  This option should contain the vendor name of the target board.
	  If it is set and
	  board/<CONFIG_SYS_VENDOR>/common/Makefile exists, the vendor common
	  directory is compiled.
	  If CONFIG_SYS_BOARD is also set, the sources under
	  board/<CONFIG_SYS_VENDOR>/<CONFIG_SYS_BOARD> directory are compiled.

	  This is optional.  For those targets without the vendor directory,
	  leave this option empty.

config SYS_BOARD
	string
	help
	  This option should contain the name of the target board.
	  If it is set, either board/<CONFIG_SYS_VENDOR>/<CONFIG_SYS_BOARD>
	  or board/<CONFIG_SYS_BOARD> directory is compiled depending on
	  whether CONFIG_SYS_VENDOR is set or not.

	  This is optional.  For those targets without the board directory,
	  leave this option empty.

config SYS_CONFIG_NAME
	string
	help
	  This option should contain the base name of board header file.
	  The header file include/configs/<CONFIG_SYS_CONFIG_NAME>.h
